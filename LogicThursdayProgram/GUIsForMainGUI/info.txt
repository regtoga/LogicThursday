This is the info page: 
This program in its very crude state while fully* functional should get better in the future.
There are so many things i want to add i could literally spend a full year developing this thing,
but I digress.

it is here that I will explain the GTT program at a simple level: 
the GTT (Gates to TruthTable) program takes gates in this form 
F = AB'C'DEF'G + A'B'C'D'E'FG' + A'B'C'D'E'F'G
and returns a function that describes a truth table, meaning you can construct every possible input and output from the function.

The TTG (Truth Table to Gates) program on the other hand does the opposite with a truth table,
we can minimize the ammount of logic gates needed to fufill the table.
This process is called circut minimization. These functions look like this:
F(A,B,C) = Z'm(2,3,4,5)+Z'd(6,7)

There is also a Logic Simulator portion of this program. In that portion you can create some logical systems and compact them as a single chip.
Secondly you can use this program to export a real design as a truth table, which you can either import into the truth table editor to see it,
or you could alternativly edit the design using the power toys. so many things to do!!!

Now hopefully enough of that made sense that you can try it out for your self...
I am very thankful for anyone who has read this far and thank you for taking a look at my program!
