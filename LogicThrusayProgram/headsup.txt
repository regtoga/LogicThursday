Things i need to add to make not suck:
1. Save/Load So that you dont loose your progress
2. ability to move inputs and outputs around so that you can atleast breath
3. Gates should get bigger based on the ammount of inputs/outputs they have so not everything spills over

a hell of a lot of other stuff like:
4. integration with my other program to make it easier to make truth tables, convert them into Diagrams and back into minimized functions....
5. there needs to be a way to handle infinite loops, i bet just by adding multiprocessing would help, look at the 2nd picture to get a better understanding.
